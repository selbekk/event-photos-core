# Event photos (Core)

This is the backend (API) part of the event photos application we're currently
creating an MVP for.
[You can find the frontend repo here](https://github.com/selbekk/event-photos-web).

This app is currently being developed. More info will come once we have
something to share.

## Development

Setting this project up for local development is still pretty easy:

### Step 1: Download dependencies

    npm install

### Step 2: Run the server

    npm start

And that's it. There's no database or persistence yet, so don't worry about that.
